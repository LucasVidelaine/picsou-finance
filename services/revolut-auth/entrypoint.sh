# Start a virtual X display, then run the API server under it.

# POST /sync launches Camoufox (Firefox) with headless=False when a re-auth is
# needed, so the process needs a DISPLAY. We start Xvfb directly instead of the
# `xvfb-run` wrapper: on this slim/trixie base xvfb-run hangs on its X-readiness
# handshake and never exec's the wrapped command, so the sidecar never comes up.
#
# Xvfb refuses to create /tmp/.X11-unix when euid != 0, so (running as the non-root
# revoauth user) we must ensure the socket dir exists before starting it.
